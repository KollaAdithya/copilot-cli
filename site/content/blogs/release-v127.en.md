# AWS Copilot v1.27: Extend Copilot templates, additional routing rule supports, preview differences, and sidecar improvements!
##### Posted On: Mar 28, 2023

The AWS Copilot core team is announcing the Copilot v1.27 release üöÄ.  
Our public [—Åommunity —Åhat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#aws_copilot-cli:gitter.im) is growing and has over 400 people online and over 2.7k stars on [GitHub](http://github.com/aws/copilot-cli/).
Thanks to every one of you who shows love and support for AWS Copilot.

Copilot v1.27 is a big release with several new features and improvements:

- **Extend Copilot templates**: You can now customize any properties in Copilot-generated AWS CloudFormation templates 
with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or YAML Patch overrides. [See detailed section](#extend-copilot-generated-aws-cloudformation-templates).
- **Enable multiple listeners and listener rules**: You can define multiple host-based or path listener rules for [application load balancers](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#http)
or multiple listeners on different ports and protocols for [network load balancers](../docs/manifest/lb-web-service.en.md#nlb).  
  [See detailed section](#enable-multiple-listeners-and-routing-rules-for-load-balancers).
- **Preview CloudFormation template changes**: You can now run `copilot [noun] package` or `copilot [noun] deploy` commmands with the `--diff` flag to show differences
  between the last deployed CloudFormation template and local changes. [See detailed section](#preview-aws-cloudformation-template-changes).
- **Build and push container images for sidecars**: Add support for `image.build` to build and push sidecar containers from local Dockerfiles. [See detailed section](#build-and-push-container-images-for-sidecar-containers).
- **Environment file support for sidecars**: Add support for `env_file` to push a local `.env` file for sidecar containers. [See detailed section](#upload-local-environment-files-for-sidecar-containers).

??? note "What‚Äôs AWS Copilot?"

    The AWS Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to build, release, and operate production-ready containerized applications on AWS.
    From getting started to releasing in production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.
    At the foundation of Copilot is AWS CloudFormation, which enables you to provision infrastructure as code.
    Copilot provides pre-defined CloudFormation templates and user-friendly workflows for different types of microservice architectures,
    enabling you to focus on developing your application instead of writing deployment scripts.

    See the [Overview](../docs/concepts/overview.en.md) section for a more detailed introduction to AWS Copilot.

## Extend Copilot-generated AWS CloudFormation templates

## Enable multiple listeners and routing rules for Load Balancers

### Add multiple host-based or path-based routing rules to your Application Load Balancers

### Add multiple port and protocol listeners to your Network Load Balancers

## Preview AWS CloudFormation template changes

## Sidecar improvements

You can now build and push container images for sidecar containers just like your main container. Additionally, you can now specify the path to a local environment file for sidecar containers.

### Build and push container images for sidecar containers

Copilot now allows users to build sidecar container images natively from Dockerfiles and push them to ECR.
In order to take advantage of this feature, users can modify their workload manifests in several ways.

The first option is to simply specify the path to the Dockerfile as a string.

```yaml
sidecars:
  nginx:
    image:
      build: path/to/dockerfile
```

Alternatively, you can specify `build` as a map, which allows for more advanced customization. 
This includes specifying the Dockerfile path, context directory, target build stage, cache from images, and build arguments.

```yaml
sidecars:
  nginx:
    image:
      build:
        dockerfile: path/to/dockerfile
        context: context/dir
        target: build-stage
        cache_from:
          - image: tag
        args: value
```

Another option is to specify an existing image URI instead of building from a Dockerfile.

```yaml
sidecars:
  nginx:
    image: 123457839156.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo/front:nginx-latest
```
Or you can provide the image URI using the location field.

```yaml
sidecars:
  nginx:
    image:
      location:  123457839156.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo/front:nginx-latest
```

### Upload local environment files for sidecar containers
